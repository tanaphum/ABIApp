#### Example 1 (0.15 genetic distance, Nematode (Ascaridida and Spirurida), COI gene) 

![Ex1](ex1.png "Example 1")

The queried genetic distance value is indicated by a grey dashed line against the range of genetic distances for each taxonomic hierarchy level.

Interpretation of output
The genetic distance of 0.15 falls within the interspecies level, indicating that the two trematode taxa are different species. The table also shows that the mean genetic distance at the species level is 0.146, and the genetic distance ranges from 0.087 to 0.177.

#### Example 2 (0.18 genetic distance, Nematode (Ascaridida and Spirurida), COI gene) 

![Ex2](ex2.png "Example 2")

The genetic distance of 0.18 falls between species and genus level. Based on the ABIapp, the COI gene result is inconclusive for the queried genetic distance. Another genetic marker is recommended for molecular analysis in this scenario to better interpret results.

#### Example 3 (0.05 genetic distance, Nematode (Ascaridida and Spirurida), COI gene) 

![Ex3](ex3.png "Example 3")

The genetic distance of 0.05 falls below the minimum distance at interspecies level, indicating the possibility of cryptic species, subspecies, or population level.
