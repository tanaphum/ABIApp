####  Before you start: 

1. Species or groups of helminths should be identified by morphological characters at the beginning. However, if the specimens are unidentifiable due to incomplete morphological characters, biological or clinical data can be used to determine probable helminth groups. 
2. The user must have the genetic sequence information obtained from one of ten molecular genetic markers to use the application. 
3. The genetic sequence information obtained can be compared with the GenBank Database to search for species that are genetically similar through BLAST. 
4. Genetic distances can be calculated by selecting approximately 3-5 similar species for sequence analysis. The pairwise distances can be analyzed using a user-friendly phylogenetics program, such as MEGA.
